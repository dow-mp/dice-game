# Left Right Center: Dice Game

A simple, switch accessible online dice game.

## Description

This is a dice game in which users click the screen to "roll" the die to determine what happens to their chips (or dollars) - do they keep them (dot), pass left (L), put into the center pot (C), or pass right (R). When only one person has chips (or dollars) remaining, that person wins the center pot and wins the game.

I designed this version with plans to make a switch accessible left right center game. In the future, I plan to add additional styling and accessibility features. 

Enjoy.
